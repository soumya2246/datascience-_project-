This project focuses on building a machine learning–based system to automatically classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. With the increasing use of email communication, spam emails have become a major problem causing inconvenience, security risks, and information overload. This project aims to address this issue by analyzing email text data and applying NLP and machine learning methods to detect spam efficiently.

In this project, raw email text data is first preprocessed using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization to clean and standardize the data. After preprocessing, the text is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency), which helps in identifying important words that contribute to distinguishing spam emails from legitimate ones. These features are then used to train a machine learning classification model.

The model is trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The results show that NLP-based machine learning models are effective in identifying spam emails with good accuracy. This project demonstrates the practical application of Data Analytics, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence in solving a real-world problem and provides a strong foundation for further improvements such as advanced models or real-time spam detection systems.
